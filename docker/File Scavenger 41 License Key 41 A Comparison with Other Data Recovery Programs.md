In this article, we will assume that you want to recover files from a disk volume. To do that, select the Scan a Disk Volume tab and then select the drive letter or device name of the volume that you want to scan from the drop-down list. You can also click on the Browse button to locate the volume manually.
 
## Step 3: Choose a scan method and start scanning
 
After selecting a disk volume to scan, you need to choose a scan method from the drop-down list below. There are four scan methods available: Quick Scan (for recently deleted files), Long Scan (for older deleted files), Defunct Volume Search (for deleted or reformatted volumes), and Exhaustive Search (for severely damaged volumes). Depending on your situation, you can choose the most suitable scan method for your recovery.
 
For example, if you have just deleted some files by mistake and want to recover them quickly, you can choose Quick Scan. If you have deleted some files a long time ago and want to recover them thoroughly, you can choose Long Scan. If you have deleted or formatted a whole volume and want to recover it completely, you can choose Defunct Volume Search. If you have a volume that has been corrupted by viruses or bad sectors and want to recover it as much as possible, you can choose Exhaustive Search.
 
Once you have chosen a scan method, click on the Start button at the bottom right corner of the interface to start scanning. The scanning process may take some time depending on the size of your volume and the scan method that you have chosen. You can see the progress of the scan in the status bar at the bottom of the interface. You can also pause or stop the scan at any time by clicking on the Pause or Stop button.
 
## Step 4: Preview and recover your files
 
When the scan is completed, File Scavenger will display a list of all the files that it has found in the main window. You can browse through the folders and files by using the tree view on the left side of the window. You can also use the search box at the top right corner of the window to find specific files by name or
