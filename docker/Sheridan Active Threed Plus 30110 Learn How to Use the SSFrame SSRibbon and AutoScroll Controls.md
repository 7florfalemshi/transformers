In this section, we will show you how to use some of the Sheridan Active Threed Plus 30110 controls in your Visual Basic 6.0 project. We will create a simple application that displays a list of products and allows the user to select one and view its details.
 
First, you need to add the Sheridan Active Threed Plus 30110 controls to your project. To do this, go to Project > Components and select the Sheridan Active Threed Plus 3.0 Controls checkbox. Click OK and you will see the controls in your toolbox.
 
Next, design your main form as shown below. You can use the SSPanel control to create a container for your other controls. You can also use the SSResizer control to make your form resizable and adjust the layout of your controls automatically. To use the SSResizer control, simply place it on your form and set its Container property to True.

Now, add some code to populate the list box with some sample products. You can use the SSTransition control to create a fade-in effect when the form loads. To use the SSTransition control, simply place it on your form and set its SourceForm property to Me. Then, in the Form\_Load event, call the Transition method with the desired effect and duration.

    Private Sub Form_Load()
        'Populate the list box with some sample products
        List1.AddItem "Sheridan Active Threed Plus 30110"
        List1.AddItem "Sheridan Active ListBar 2.0"
        List1.AddItem "Sheridan Active TreeView 3.0"
        List1.AddItem "Sheridan Active ToolBars Plus 2.0"
        List1.AddItem "Sheridan Active Widgets 3.0"
        
        'Create a fade-in effect using the SSTransition control
        SSTransition1.Transition sstFadeIn, 1000
    End Sub

Next, add another form to display the details of the selected product. You can use the SSRibbon control to create a toolbar with buttons for closing the form and visiting the product website. You can also use the SSScroll control to create a scrollable container for the product description. To use the SSScroll control, simply place it on your form and set its AutoScroll property to True. Then, place a label or a text box inside it and set its MultiLine property to True.

Now, add some code to show the detail form when the user clicks on a product in the list box. You can use the SSTransition control to create a slide-in effect when the detail form shows. To use the SSTransition control, simply place it on your detail form and set its SourceForm property to Me. Then, in the Form\_Activate event, call the Transition method with the desired effect and duration.

    Private Sub List1_Click()
        'Get the selected product name
        Dim ProductName As String
        ProductName = List1.Text
        
        'Show the detail form with the product name as caption
        DetailForm.Caption = ProductName
        DetailForm.Show
        
        'Show different product details based on the product name
        Select Case ProductName
            Case "Sheridan Active Threed Plus 30110"
                DetailForm.Image1.Picture = LoadPicture("threed.jpg")
                DetailForm.Text1.Text = "Sheridan Active Threed Plus 30110 is a set of eleven 32-bit ActiveX controls that give your applications ..."
