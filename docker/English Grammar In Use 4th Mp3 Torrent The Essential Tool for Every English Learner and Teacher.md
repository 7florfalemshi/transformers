In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use HDPsyChart for various psychrometric applications. We will assume that you have already installed and activated the full version of HDPsyChart on your computer.
 
## Example 1: Cooling and Dehumidifying Air
 
Suppose you want to cool and dehumidify air from an initial state of 30Â°C dry bulb temperature and 60% relative humidity to a final state of 20Â°C dry bulb temperature and 50% relative humidity. How much cooling and dehumidification is required? What is the final wet bulb temperature and enthalpy of the air?
 
To answer these questions, you can use HDPsyChart to draw the process on the psychrometric chart. Here are the steps:

1. Open HDPsyChart and select SI units from the menu.
2. Click on the "New Point" button and enter the initial state of the air: 30Â°C dry bulb temperature and 60% relative humidity. A point labeled "P1" will appear on the chart.
3. Click on the "New Process" button and select "Cooling/Dehumidification" from the drop-down menu. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the final state of the air: 20Â°C dry bulb temperature and 50% relative humidity. Click "OK" and a line labeled "P1-P2" will appear on the chart, connecting the initial and final points.
4. Click on the "Properties" button and select "Process Properties" from the drop-down menu. A table will appear where you can see the properties of the initial and final points, as well as the process. You can see that the cooling required is 10.6 kJ/kg of dry air, and the dehumidification required is 4.4 g/kg of dry air. You can also see that the final wet bulb temperature is 15.9Â°C and the final enthalpy is 42.8 kJ/kg of dry air.

You can also export the chart and the table to other formats such as PDF, Excel, Word, etc. by clicking on the "Export" button.
 
## Example 2: Heating and Humidifying Air
 
Suppose you want to heat and humidify air from an initial state of 10Â°C dry bulb temperature and 20% relative humidity to a final state of 25Â°C dry bulb temperature and 40% relative humidity. How much heating and humidification is required? What is the final dew point temperature and entropy of the air?
 
To answer these questions, you can use HDPsyChart to draw the process on the psychrometric chart. Here are the steps:

1. Open HDPsyChart and select SI units from the menu.
2. Click on the "New Point" button and enter the initial state of the air: 10Â°C dry bulb temperature and 20% relative humidity. A point labeled "P1" will appear on the chart.
3. Click on the "New Process" button and select "Heating/Humidification" from the drop-down menu. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the final state of the air: 25Â°C dry bulb temperature and 40% relative humidity. Click "OK" and a line labeled "P1-P2" will appear on the chart, connecting the initial and final points.
4. Click on the "Properties" button and select "Process Properties" from the drop-down menu. A table will appear where you can see the properties of the initial and final points, as well as the process. You can see that the heating required is 19.7 kJ/kg of dry air, and the humidification required is 5 g/kg of dry air. You can also see that the final dew point temperature is 11Â°C and the final entropy is 0.18 kJ/kg K of dry air.

You can also export the chart and the table to other formats such as PDF, Excel, Word, etc. by clicking on the "Export" button.
