PULSE was part of the Division Bell Tour, which was the final tour by the band before their hiatus and eventual reunion in 2005. The tour supported their 14th studio album, The Division Bell, which was released two days before the tour's start date. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number one in several countries and winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.
 
The concert featured a stunning setlist that spanned the band's entire career, from their early psychedelic hits like "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" and "One of These Days" to their later classics like "Another Brick in the Wall" and "Comfortably Numb". The show also included a complete performance of their masterpiece album, The Dark Side of the Moon, which is one of the best-selling albums of all time. The concert was accompanied by spectacular visual effects, such as lasers, pyrotechnics, inflatables, and a giant circular screen that displayed animations and videos.

In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the highlights of PULSE, and explore the meaning and significance of some of the songs and visuals. We will also compare and contrast PULSE with some of the other live shows by Pink Floyd, and discuss why PULSE stands out as a unique and unforgettable experience.
 
One of the most striking aspects of PULSE is the use of the circular screen, which was designed by Storm Thorgerson, a longtime collaborator of the band. The screen was inspired by the cover art of The Dark Side of the Moon, which featured a prism refracting a beam of light into a rainbow. The screen displayed various images and videos that complemented the songs, such as clocks for "Time", money for "Money", and a heartbeat for "Speak to Me". The screen also showed footage from previous Pink Floyd concerts, such as Live at Pompeii and The Wall Live in Berlin, creating a sense of continuity and nostalgia.
 
Another notable feature of PULSE is the inclusion of several songs that were rarely performed live by the band, such as "Astronomy Domine", "The Great Gig in the Sky", and "High Hopes". These songs showcased the band's versatility and range, as well as their respect for their own history and evolution. Some of these songs also featured guest musicians, such as Clare Torry, who sang the iconic vocal solo on "The Great Gig in the Sky", and Sam Brown, who joined David Gilmour on vocals for "Comfortably Numb". These collaborations added an extra layer of emotion and depth to the performance.
 
PULSE also demonstrated the band's mastery of sound and light, which created a mesmerizing and immersive atmosphere for the audience. The concert was recorded using a 48-track digital system, which captured every nuance and detail of the music. The sound quality was enhanced by using quadraphonic speakers, which surrounded the audience with sound from all directions. The concert also featured an impressive array of lasers, pyrotechnics, inflatables, and other effects, which synchronized with the music and added to the visual spectacle. Some of the most memorable moments were the flying pig during "One of These Days", the exploding plane during "On the Run", and the giant disco ball during "Comfortably Numb".
