## Modes
 
Left 4 Dead 1.0.2.5 Nosteam Cracked CODEX has four modes that you can play:

- Campaign: This is the main mode of the game, where you and up to three other players play through four scenarios or \"movies\" that have different settings, characters, and objectives. Each scenario has five chapters that end with a finale where you have to hold off a massive horde of zombies while waiting for rescue. You can choose from four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Advanced, and Expert. The higher the difficulty, the more damage you take from zombies and friendly fire, the fewer items you find, and the smarter the AI Director becomes. The AI Director is a system that dynamically changes the game based on your performance, such as spawning more or less zombies, changing their behavior, altering the environment, and creating random events.
- Single Player: This is similar to Campaign mode, but you play alone with three AI-controlled survivors. You can also pause the game and issue commands to your teammates, such as follow me, stay here, or use your health kit. You can switch between the survivors at any time by pressing the F1-F4 keys.
- Survival: This is a mode where you and up to three other players try to survive as long as possible against endless waves of zombies in a small map. There is no rescue or escape in this mode, only death. You can choose from 16 maps that are based on locations from the Campaign mode. You can also see how your time compares to other players on the leaderboards.
- Versus: This is a competitive mode where two teams of four players take turns playing as the survivors and the special infected. The special infected are zombies that have unique abilities and attacks that can hinder or kill the survivors. There are six types of special infected: Boomer, Hunter, Smoker, Tank, Witch, and Charger. The team playing as the survivors tries to reach the safe room at the end of each chapter while the team playing as the special infected tries to stop them or kill them. The game scores each team based on how far they got as survivors and how much damage they did as special infected. The team with the highest score after four rounds wins.
