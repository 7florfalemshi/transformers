## Step 2: Open a GameCube ISO File
 
To open a GameCube ISO file, you can either drag and drop it to the GCIT window or click on the "Open" button and browse to the file location. GCIT will automatically detect the format of the file and display some information about it, such as size, name, ID, region, etc.
 
## Step 3: Choose a Conversion Format
 
To convert a GameCube ISO file to another format, you need to choose a conversion format from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the GCIT window. You can choose from GCM, ISO, GCZ, CISO, and WBFS formats. Each format has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your needs and preferences.
 
GCM is the original format of GameCube discs and it has no compression or encryption. It is compatible with most emulators and loaders but it takes up more space than other formats.
 
ISO is a standard format for optical disc images and it can be burned to discs or mounted as virtual drives. It is also compatible with most emulators and loaders but it has no compression or encryption either.
 
GCZ is a compressed format that reduces the size of GameCube ISOs by removing unused data and applying zlib compression. It is compatible with Dolphin emulator and Dios Mios Lite loader but it may not work with other emulators or loaders.
 
CISO is another compressed format that reduces the size of GameCube ISOs by applying lz77 compression. It is compatible with Dios Mios Lite loader but it may not work with other emulators or loaders.
 
WBFS is a format that splits GameCube ISOs into smaller files that can be stored on FAT32 partitions. It is compatible with Wii Backup Manager and USB Loader GX but it may not work with other emulators or loaders.
 
## Step 4: Convert the GameCube ISO File
 
After choosing a conversion format, you can click on the "Convert" button to start the conversion process. GCIT will ask you to choose a destination folder for the converted file and then show you a progress bar while converting the file. The conversion time may vary depending on the size and format of the file.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Your Converted GameCube ISO File
 
Once the conversion is done, you can find your converted GameCube ISO file in the destination folder you chose. You can then use it for backup or USB loading purposes with your preferred emulator or loader. You can also use GCIT to convert other GameCube ISO files in different formats.
 
### Conclusion
 
GCIT 1.2 is a handy tool that allows you to convert GameCube ISOs between various formats for backup or USB loading purposes. It is easy to use and supports multiple formats such as GCM, ISO, GCZ, CISO, and WBFS. You can download it from http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/gcit.html and
