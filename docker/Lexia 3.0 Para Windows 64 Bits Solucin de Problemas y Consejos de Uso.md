## Method 1: Using a Virtual Machine
 
A virtual machine is a software that simulates a different operating system on your computer. You can use a virtual machine to run Windows XP 32 bits on your Windows 64 bits system, and then install Lexia 3.0 on the virtual machine. This is the most reliable and safe method, as it does not affect your main system or require any modifications. However, it may require more disk space and memory, and you will need a valid license for Windows XP.
 
To use this method, you will need to download and install a virtual machine software such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. Then, you will need to create a new virtual machine and install Windows XP 32 bits on it. You can follow the instructions from the virtual machine software provider or from this link[^1^]. After installing Windows XP 32 bits on the virtual machine, you can install Lexia 3.0 software on it as usual.
 
## Method 2: Using Compatibility Mode
 
Compatibility mode is a feature of Windows that allows you to run older programs that are not compatible with your current system. You can use compatibility mode to run Lexia 3.0 software on Windows 64 bits by changing some settings. This method is simpler and faster than using a virtual machine, but it may not work for all functions or devices, and it may cause some errors or instability.
 
To use this method, you will need to right-click on the Lexia 3.0 setup file and select Properties. Then, go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for". From the drop-down menu, select Windows XP (Service Pack 3). You can also check the box that says "Run this program as an administrator" for better results. Click Apply and OK to save the changes. Then, run the Lexia 3.0 setup file as usual.
 
## Method 3: Using Diagbox Software
 
Diagbox is a newer diagnostic software for Peugeot and Citroen cars that includes Lexia 3.0 and PP2000 functions. Diagbox software is compatible with Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows XP, both 32 bits and 64 bits. You can use Diagbox software to run Lexia 3.0 functions on Windows 64 bits without any problems. However, you will need to buy a Diagbox interface or a Lexia interface that supports Diagbox software.
 
To use this method, you will need to download and install Diagbox software from this link[^1^] or from your interface provider. Then, you will need to connect your interface to your car and your computer using a USB cable. You can follow the instructions from the Diagbox software provider or from this link[^1^] to install and activate Diagbox software on your computer. After installing Diagbox software on your computer, you can launch it and select Lexia 3.0 functions from the menu.
