## Step 5: Create a report using Crystal Report
 
Now that you have installed Crystal Report for Visual Studio 2012, you can start creating reports for your applications. There are different ways to create a report using Crystal Report, but one of the easiest ways is to use the Crystal Report Wizard. The Wizard guides you through each step in creating a report, such as selecting a data source, choosing fields, applying filters, formatting the layout, and adding charts and summaries.
 
To create a report using the Crystal Report Wizard, follow these steps:
 
1. In Visual Studio 2012, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select Add > New Item.
2. In the Add New Item dialog box, select Reporting from the left pane and Crystal Reports from the right pane. Enter a name for your report and click Add.
3. The Crystal Report Gallery will appear. Select Using the Report Wizard and click OK.
4. The Crystal Report Wizard will start. On the first screen, select a data source for your report. You can choose from various types of data sources, such as databases, XML files, web services, etc. For this example, we will use a Microsoft SQL Server database. Click on Create New Connection and expand the Microsoft SQL Server node. Enter the server name, authentication mode, database name, and user name and password if required. Click Next.
5. On the next screen, select the tables or views that you want to use in your report. You can also add joins or links between them if needed. Click Next.
6. On the next screen, select the fields that you want to display in your report. You can drag and drop fields from the Available Fields list to the Fields to Display list. You can also group your data by one or more fields by dragging them to the Group By list. Click Next.
7. On the next screen, you can apply filters or conditions to your data. For example, you can show only records that match certain criteria or values. You can also use formulas or parameters to create dynamic filters. Click Next.
8. On the next screen, you can choose a layout for your report. You can select from various predefined layouts or customize your own layout using options such as orientation, paper size, margins, etc. You can also preview how your report will look like on this screen. Click Next.
9. On the next screen, you can add charts and summaries to your report. Charts can help you visualize your data in graphical form, such as pie charts, bar charts, line charts, etc. Summaries can help you calculate totals, averages, counts, etc. for your data. You can drag and drop fields from the Available Fields list to the Chart Data list or Summary Fields list. You can also choose from various chart types and styles on this screen. Click Finish.
10. Your report is now created and displayed in the Crystal Reports Designer. You can further modify your report using various tools and options available in the Designer. You can also preview your report using the Preview tab at the bottom of the Designer.

## Step 6: Run and deploy your report
 
After creating your report using Crystal Report for Visual Studio 2012, you can run and deploy it in your application. To run your report, you need to use a Crystal Report Viewer control that allows you to display and interact with your report in your application.
 
To use a Crystal Report Viewer control, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio 2012, open or create a Windows Forms or Web Forms application that will host your report.
2. In the Toolbox, expand the SAP Crystal Reports section and drag and drop a CrystalReportViewer control onto your form or page.
3. In the Properties window of the CrystalReportViewer control, set the ReportSource property to point to your report file.
4. Run your application and you will see your report displayed in the CrystalReportViewer control.

To deploy your report, you need to distribute some files along with your application that are required by Crystal Report Runtime Engine for .NET Framework. These files include assemblies, configuration files, license files, etc. You can use various methods to deploy these files, such as ClickOnce deployment, Windows Installer deployment, manual deployment, etc.
