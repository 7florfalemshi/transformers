If you are looking for a collection of classic and modern drum sounds for your Nexus 2 rompler, you might want to check out the Vintage DrumKits expansion pack from ReFX. This pack features 65 complete drumkits (each containing 61 GM-mapped samples), 66 loops and 10 bonus-sequences[^1^] [^2^]. You can find virtually every cult-machine in this pack, from the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 to the LinnDrum and Oberheim DMX, as well as some contemporary kits with punchy and crisp sounds[^2^]. With nearly 4000 single-samples, this pack offers a lot of variety and quality for your drum tracks[^1^] [^2^].
 
The Vintage DrumKits expansion pack also comes with two new insert effects: Gate and Compressor, which can be used to shape the dynamics and transients of your drums[^1^]. You can also modulate the cutoff and resonance of each layer with the new modulation destinations[^1^]. The librarian has been improved with three font-sizes that can be cycled by clicking on the title-bar[^1^]. These features are part of the Nexus 2.2 update, which also fixes some bugs and issues with the previous version[^1^].
